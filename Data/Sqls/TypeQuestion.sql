A hurricane begins as a tropical storm. The storm winds blow in circles around a center, called the "eye." Gradually, the winds get stronger and stronger. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when the winds are 120 kilometers per hour or more.
The word "hurricane" comes from Huracan, an evil god of a Central American Indian tribe. In other parts of the world, hurricanes are known by different names. In East Asia, they are usually called typhoons, from the Chinese tai-feng, meaning "great wind." In Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, and Australia, they are known as cyclones. Finally, in the Philippines, they are called baguios.
Few things in nature have as much power as hurricanes. They can destroy coastal areas with heavy rains and winds of 250 kilometers per hour or more. Sometimes a hurricane causes the ocean to flood onto land in an event called a storm surge. The total power of a hurricane may be equal to 10,000 nuclear bombs.', NULL, 1, 0)
